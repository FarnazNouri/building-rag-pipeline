 
Machine learning allows computers to learn from data and improve performance on tasks without explicit programming. The core process involves collecting and preparing data, selecting an algorithm, training a model, and evaluating its accuracy to make predictions. The three primary types of machine learning are supervised learning (using labeled data for tasks like classification and regression), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data, like clustering), and reinforcement learning (learning from rewards and penalties in an environment).
Key Concepts
Data is Crucial: High-quality, diverse data is the foundation of machine learning, providing the examples for models to learn from. 
Algorithms & Models: An algorithm is a set of instructions that enables the computer to learn from data, while a model is the trained output of the algorithm. 
Features: These are the attributes or characteristics extracted from data that are used by the model to learn and make decisions. 
Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning:
How it works: Uses labeled datasets, where the correct input-output relationships are known, to train the model. 
Examples: Image recognition (labeling photos as "cat" or "dog") and spam email filtering. 
Unsupervised Learning:
How it works: Works with unlabeled data to identify hidden patterns, similarities, and groupings on its own. 
Examples: Clustering data points to find common characteristics or detecting anomalies in datasets. 
Reinforcement Learning:
How it works: An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. 
Examples: Training a robot to navigate or a program to play a game by playing against itself.
